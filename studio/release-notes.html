On iOS 9, to prevent application content from expanding the view when DOM elements move off screen, you’ll want to add the directive <code>shrink-to-fit=no</code> to the meta “viewport” setting in index.html. You don’t need to do any specific platform check when using this setting; it can be used for both iOS and Android (the directive is ignored on Android, which does not have this problem in the first place).</li>

		<li>No need to configure routers or firewalls.</li>
		<li>Easy to connect to Evothings Workbench for users independently of physical location or network. You can now develop mobile IoT apps anywhere as long as you have an Internet connection. Moreover, you can demo apps remotely for users and customers, running your apps directly on their mobile devices.</li>
		<li>Improved caching that results in quicker loading of apps.</li>
		<li>Quicker live reload (automatic reload when saving a file). Speedup is a factor of 3-4 for large applications.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Evothings Studio Workbench</h3>
	<ul>

		<li>Quickly connect to the Workbench you are logged in to next time you launch the Viewer. No need to generate and enter a connect key, very quick to connect with just one button press.</li>
		<li>Connect from anywhere on the Internet. Users can connect to remote Workbenches by entering the corresponding connect key, to do testing and remote demos.</li>
		<li>Available for iOS and Android.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Evothings Studio 1.2.0</h2>

	<p>Find all downloads for this version of Evothings Studio at: <a href="https://evothings.com/download">evothings.com/download</a></p>

	<h3>Evothings Workbench</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Supported platforms for Evothings Workbench are OS X, Windows and Linux.</li>
		<li>Updated documentation.</li>
		<li>New example apps.</li>
		<li>Bugfixes.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Example apps</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Several new and updated example apps for the TI SensorTag CC2650 and CC2541.</li>
		<li>New example apps for ARM mbed ("mbed Custom GAP" and "mbed Custom GATT") contributed by the mbed community. Many thanks for this much appreciated contribution!
		<li>New example app for Nordic Semiconductor and ARM mbed ("Nordic Semiconductor nRF51 DK BLE").</li>
		<li>New example app "Cordova Accelerometer" that demonstrates how to read the accelerometer of the mobile device. This example replaces the "Cordova Basic" example.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Libraries</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The JavaScript library for TI SensorTag has been refactored and extended.</li>
		<li>The FastClick library is now included with all examples for a responsive UI experience.</li>
		<li>Bugfixes.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Known issues</h3>
	<p>During testing, we have experienced the following issues with the current firmware versions (0.89 and 1.01) of the TI SensorTag CC2650:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The SensorTag has been observed to disconnect when in use.</li>
		<li>
Simultaneously enabling movement sensors (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer) and Luxometer sensors has been reported to make sensors stop working.</li>
		<li>
The Magnetometer sensor freezes after displaying initial values.</li>
		<li>
Calculations of sensor values for Humidity, Accelerometer, and Gyroscope need to be investigated and possibly revised. Calculations for Temperature, Barometer and Luxometer have been tested correct.</li>
		<li>
If problems are experienced, try to power cycle the SensorTag as a workaround (remove and insert battery).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We have experienced that the example apps for Nordic Semiconductor nRF51 DK and ARM mbed sometimes don't work reliably on Android (issues observed with LG Flex and Google Nexus 7).</p>

	<p>Evothings Workbench may crash when switching network or switching user and logging in again. As a workaround, please quit the Workbench before switching user.</p>

	<p>Calls to hyper.log() cause Evothings Workbench to crash when passing in data objects that cannot be cloned by node-webkit function Window.postMessage. Examples are function objects and certain binary encoded data. As a workaround, pass only plain strings or stringified objects to hyper.log().</p>

	<p>On OS X, if Evothings Workbench should crash, you need to Force Quit to terminate the application.</p>

		<li>New library file <a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/blob/master/resources/libs/evothings/evothings.js">evothings.js</a>, which must be included in all apps that use Evothings library functions. Supports asynchronous loading of JavaScript libraries, using the evothings.loadScript function. Use function evothings.scriptsLoaded(doneCallback) to ensure all script have been loaded, or pass a callback to evothings.loadScript to know when a single script has loaded. These callbacks take no parameters.</li>
		<li>New JavaScript library evothings.util with support for number conversions etc.
		<li>The cordova-ble plugin has support for accessing advertisement data using the easyble.js library.</li>
		<li>easyble.js asynchronously loads util.js. To be safe, use evothings.scriptsLoaded(doneCallback) to ensure all scripts are loaded before using functions in easyble.js. Example TI SensorTag Sensors uses this method, see code at the end of <a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/blob/master/examples/ti-sensortag-sensors/index.html">index.html</a>.</li>
