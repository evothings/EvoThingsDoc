	<h1>Dialog Semiconductor IoT Sensor</h1>
	
	<p><b>Control your Dialog IoT Sensor using JavaScript</b>. This application demonstrates the functionality of the <a href="http://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/iotsensor" target="_blank">DA14583 IoT Sensor</a>. The Dialog IoT Sensor provides the means to gather and process sensor data among six different sensors.</p>
	
	<p>The data is gathered by the DA14583, processed and transferred over Bluetooth Low Energy to the application running on the smartphone.</p>
	
	<p>Using the ‘Scan’ button the application scans for Bluetooth devices in the area. Once a device is found, the name and RSSI value of the device and a connect button is shown. After a certain period the app stops scanning to save the phone’s battery. </p>
	
	<p>Once the phone is connected to the sensor a list of available sensors is shown. Clicking one of the sensors opens a graphical view as seen below. Data is automatically updated every time new sensor data is available.</p>
	
	<p>Via the settings menu the sensor can be configured. The settings menu is split up in three parts: sensor configuration, calibration and sensor fusion settings. Changes in the settings are automatically stored in the sensor and can also be stored in flash memory. A ‘Reset to default’ button restores all settings of the sensor to default.</p>
	
	<p>This example uses a high-level JavaScript library for communicating with the Dialog IoT Sensor. See the <a href="https://evothings.com/dialog-iot-sensor-starter-guide/" target="_blank">IoT Sensor Starter Guide</a> to build your own app using the library!</p>

	<h2>Source code</h2>

	<p>You can browse the source code for this example at the <a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/tree/master/examples/dialog-iotsensor" target="_blank">Evothings GitHub repository</a>.</p>
	
	<p>The file <a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/blob/master/examples/dialog-iotsensor/app/index.html" target="_blank">index.html</a> is the main HTML file of the app. You can find custom CSS in <a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/blob/master/examples/dialog-iotsensor/app/app.css" target="_blank">app.css</a></p>
	
	<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/tree/master/examples/dialog-iotsensor/app/js" target="_blank">js folder</a> you will find all JavaScript code required for the app.</p>
	
	<p>The directory <a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/tree/master/examples/dialog-iotsensor/DA14583" target="_blank">DA14583</a> contains the binaries for the Dialog IoT Sensor. You can also find these files on <a href="http://support.dialog-semiconductor.com/connectivity" target="_blank">Dialog’s customer support site</a>. <b><i>You must use the SFL firmware for this app to function!</i></b></p>

	<!-- Explain what the user needs in terms of hardware as well as softare in order to run the example -->
	<h2>What you need</h2>

	<p>This example works with an Dialog IoT Sensor. Visit <a href="http://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/iotsensor" target="_blank">dialog-semiconductor.com</a> for further details.</p>

	<p>You can order your own IoT Sensor via <a href="http://www.digikey.com/en/product-highlight/d/dialog-semi/da14583-iot-sensor-development-kit" target="_blank">Digi-Key</a> or <a href="http://nl.mouser.com/new/dialog-semiconductor/dialog-da14583-kit/" target="_blank">Mouser</a>. For other distributors, visit the <a href="http://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/bluetooth-smart/buy" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Using <a href="http://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/bluetooth-smart/development-tools" target="_blank">Dialog’s SmartSnippets Bluetooth software platform</a> you can store the image file to flash memory of the device. The SmartSnippets software can be found on <a href="http://support.dialog-semiconductor.com/connectivity" target="_blank">Dialog’s customer support site</a> (registration required).</p>

	<p>Run the app in Evothings Viewer on Android or iOS.</p>
	
	<p>An iOS device (7+) or an Android device with support for Bluetooth 4.0 (which includes BLE) is required. For Android, version 4.3 or later is needed.</p>

	<!-- Explain briefly how to get up and running -->
	<h2>How to get up and running</h2>
	
	<p>
	Follow these steps to get started with this example:
		<ul>
			<li>Turn on the Dialog IoT Sensor (make sure to use the SFL firmware). Make sure the blue LED is blinking (advertising mode).</li>
			<li>Run Evothings Workbench on your desktop/laptop.</li>
			<li>Run Evothings Viewer on a mobile device and connect to the workbench</li>
			<li>Launch the example “Dialog Semiconductor IoT Sensor” from the Workbench window in the ‘EXAMPLE’ tab by pressing ‘RUN’</li>
			<li>The app automatically starts scanning for IoT Sensor’s in the area. Click ‘CONNECT’ next to the IoT Sensor SFL to connect to the sensor.</li>
			<li>Click one of the sensors to read the data of the sensor and display the data graphically.</li>
			<li>Use the ‘SETTINGS’ button to fully control your Dialog IoT Sensor. You can reset, change or store the settings in the flash memory of the IoT Sensor.</li>
		</ul>
